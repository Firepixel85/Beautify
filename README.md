# General
## About üê≥
Bittify is a rebuild of [Minify](https://github.com/Jyodann/MinifyPlayer/) in the Godot Engine. 

It is a Miniplayer built for Windows, MacOS and Linux which shows the current song you have playing on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/). 

Useful for people who want to see what songs are currently playing without constantly tabbing back to the main application. It also be used as a Window Source on OBS for Twitch streamers to easily show what they are listening to.

## FAQ ü§î

### Why does the player take so long to refresh my song?

Sadly, due to [Spotify's Usage Quotas](https://developer.spotify.com/policy#vii-access-usage-and-quotas) , I have to limit the number of times I ask the Spotify Servers for information. I am actively looking for a better way to do things, if you have any ideas, please feel free to drop me an email here: jordynwinnie@gmail.com or open a pull request

# Technical Details
## Why did you re-write this in Godot (again)? üí≠

When using Unity, I faced many issues with Window-based opeartions, and also MacOS was really wonky with Unity. Godot was choosen due to the simpler Window Manager, and also after a lot of experimentation. I will be writing this whole application with GDScript, and re-architecting the app to support quicker building of features. 

There are actually a few other builds of Bittify/Minify, here are some of them and the issues I have faced:

- Godot (with C#)
    For some reason, C# support does not have the proper async/await use with the HTTPRequest Node, so even though a lot of the app was finished with Godot C#, I ultimately had to drop it. Godot has also yet to rework some of the GDScript features (like exporting to web) for C#
- Tauri (Rust+Svelte+TailwindCSS)
    I spent maybe 4 weeks on this build. I ultimately had to scrap it as the windowing and media queries for the Marquee effect were a bit too much for me to handle.
