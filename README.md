# Bittify 🎵🎶

## About 🐳

Bittify is a rebuild of [Minify](https://github.com/Jyodann/MinifyPlayer/) in the Godot Engine. 

It is a Miniplayer built for Windows, MacOS and Linux which shows the current song you have playing on [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/windows/). 

Useful for people who want to see what songs are currently playing without constantly tabbing back to the main application. It also be used as a Window Source on OBS for Twitch streamers to easily show what they are listening to.
